Deterministic Policy Gradient Method with recurrent neural networks for solving the partial observability problem in an POMDP(Partially-Observable Markov Decision Process). DPG optimizes or shifts the probability mass to a deterministic policy, while continuing to explore through its Stochastic Behavior Policy.
